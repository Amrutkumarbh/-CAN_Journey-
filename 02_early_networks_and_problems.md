02 — Why Vehicle Networks Were Needed + Early Solutions

> **Personal notes from my CAN learning journey** — transcribed from handwritten notes, Page 2

The Result of Point-to-Point Wiring

- A **1990s car** had approximately **~2 km of wiring**
- Heavy, expensive, and error-prone
- **Adding a new feature = adding new wires**

> This is exactly the problem that **Vehicle Networks** were designed to solve.

Advantages of Vehicle Networking

1. Reduced Wiring
Lower cost and less weight by sharing a single bus instead of running individual wires.

2. Real-Time Data Sharing
Enables safety-critical systems like **ABS and airbags** to react in milliseconds using shared sensor data.

3. Built-in Error Handling
High reliability in harsh environments (vibration, temperature, EMI) through protocol-level error detection.

4. Single Diagnostic Port
Easy, standardized servicing — one port to read fault codes from all ECUs.

5. Modular / Scalable Architecture
Easy to add or upgrade features across new vehicle models without rewiring.

6. Weight Reduction
Directly improves efficiency and is critical for **EV range optimization**.

7. Enables ADAS and Autonomy
The future of vehicles — lane keeping, adaptive cruise, self-parking, and autonomous driving — all depend on high-speed networked ECUs.

8. Industry Standardization
**Interoperability** — the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of data — across **OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers)** and their suppliers.

Early Multiplexed Networks (Before CAN Dominated)

Before a universal standard emerged, each manufacturer built their own proprietary network:

| Manufacturer | Protocol | Full Name |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| General Motors (GM) | J1850 VPW | Variable Pulse Width |
| Ford | J1850 PWM | Pulse Width Modulation |
| Chrysler | CCD | Chrysler Collision Detection |
| Peugeot | VAN | Vehicle Area Network |
| BMW | I-Bus | Instrumentation Bus |

Issues with Proprietary Early Networks

❌ **No plug-and-play** possible between brands
❌ **Low re-use** of components across OEMs
❌ **High cost** — every manufacturer reinvented the wheel
❌ **ECUs heavily customized** per OEM — no cross-compatibility
❌ No shared benefits across the industry

> This fragmentation is what drove the industry toward a universal standard — **CAN (Controller Area Network)**.
